AI Stock Price Prediction with GAN & Blockchain
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project predicts future stock prices using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and provides the best day to buy and sell a stock. All recommendations are optionally stored on a blockchain (Ganache) for immutability and security.

âš¡ Features

Predicts stock prices for the next 30 days using historical data.

Identifies the optimal buy and sell day.

Visualizes price trends and recommendations with charts.

Stores buy/sell points on Ethereum blockchain for safety.

Fetches live stock data directly via Yahoo Finance.
